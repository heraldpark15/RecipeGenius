## About The Project

![recipegeniuspreview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bee70ae-be93-4aef-b9df-db289be7e39e)

Imagine having a world-class chef with unmatched creativity working with you personally to create the best dishes and drinks. Sounds like a great deal right? 

This becomes reality with RecipeGenius, your personal AI assistant for the kitchen. 
This wrapper application leverages generative AI to create a chatbot engineered to provide tailored meals and drinks recipe for each occasion.
Specify particular ingredients to use, or just bounce ideas to RecipeGenius -- date night, easy breakfast, low-calorie Mediterranean, whatever your heart desires!


This project is part of Grad 5900: Applied Generative AI at the University of Connecticut-Storrs.
